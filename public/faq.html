                Most of our campus cats are friendly and used to human interaction. However, we recommend approaching them calmly and letting them come to you. Some cats may be more shy or wary. All cats in our program are vaccinated and monitored for health issues. If you encounter a cat that appears sick or aggressive, please <a href="/report.html">report it</a> to us immediately.

                TNR stands for Trap-Neuter-Return. It is the most humane and effective method for managing community cat populations. We humanely trap cats, have them spayed or neutered by a veterinarian, and return them to their territory. This prevents new litters while allowing the existing cats to live out their lives in their familiar environment. Over time, the colony size naturally stabilizes and decreases.

                Yes! Some of our campus cats are friendly enough for indoor home life and are available for adoption. Visit our <a href="/adopt.html">Adopt page</a> to see cats currently available and to submit an adoption application. Each cat is health-checked, vaccinated, and spayed/neutered before going to their new home.

                Our volunteers maintain a daily feeding schedule, with cats being fed twice a day &mdash; once in the morning and once in the evening. We have designated feeding stations across campus, and each station is assigned to specific volunteers who ensure fresh food and water are always available.

                We appreciate the thought, but we ask that you do not feed the cats outside of our organized feeding program. Some cats have dietary restrictions or health conditions, and uncontrolled feeding can lead to overfeeding, attract pests, and make it difficult to monitor each cat&rsquo;s health. If you would like to contribute food, you can donate supplies through our <a href="/donate.html">donation page</a>.
